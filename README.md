**Arch as code** is an approach for managing **software architecture as
code**.

By following this approach we will be able to **manage our architecture
documents, models, decisions and diagrams** in the same way we do code
thus benefiting from all **tools, techniques and workflows supporting
modern development**. Think PR reviews, static code analysis, continuous
integration & continuous deployment.

Specifically we are making use of the
[Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) tool by Simon Brown as the basis
for structuring and storing our architecture models, decisions, views
and documentation.

## Getting started

### 1. Create Structurizr account

First you'll need to create a Structurizr account. You can do this by
following the Structurizr
[getting started](https://structurizr.com/help/getting-started) guide
that describes how to setup a new account and get a **free** workspace.

### 2. Use Java 11 locally

The build currently assumes Java 11.  Several tools exist to manage multiple
JDK versions.  A good choice is [jEnv](https://www.jenv.be/).

### 3. Install arch-as-code CLI

Arch as code requires Java 11 or greater to be installed.

You can download the latest arch-as-code tarball
[here](https://github.com/trilogy-group/arch-as-code/releases/latest) or
you can run commands for your respective OS below to install the latest
version of arch-as-code CLI.

#### Mac OS

```bash
mkdir -p ~/arch-as-code && curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/trilogy-group/arch-as-code/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url" | cut -d : -f 2,3 | tr -d \" | xargs curl -L | tar --strip-components 1 -x -C ~/arch-as-code

export PATH=$PATH:~/arch-as-code/bin

arch-as-code --help
```

#### Linux

```bash
mkdir -p ~/arch-as-code && curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/trilogy-group/arch-as-code/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url" | cut -d : -f 2,3 | tr -d \" | xargs curl -L | tar -z --strip-components 1 -x -C ~/arch-as-code

export PATH=$PATH:~/arch-as-code/bin

arch-as-code --help
```

#### Windows

```powershell
Invoke-Expression "& { $(Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trilogy-group/arch-as-code/master/scripts/install/windows/install.ps1 -Headers @{"Cache-Control"="no-cache"} ) }"

arch-as-code --help
```

### 4. Initialize local workspace

Next we'll initialize a new local workspace to store our architecture
assets as code.

In order to do this you'll need to retrieve your Structurizr
WORKSPACE_ID, WORKSPACE_API_KEY and WORKSPACE_API_SECRET from the
Structurizr account
[dashboard](https://structurizr.com/dashboard).<!-- @IGNORE PREVIOUS: link -->

Then you can then run the following command to initialize your workspace
(PATH_TO_WORKSPACE refers to workspace directory).

```bash
mkdir -p ${PATH_TO_WORKSPACE}

cd ${PATH_TO_WORKSPACE}

arch-as-code init -i ${WORKSPACE_ID} -k ${WORKSPACE_API_KEY} -s ${WORKSPACE_API_SECRET} .
```

### 5. Publish to Structurizr

We can now publish our local workspace to Structurizr using the
following command:

```bash
cd ${PATH_TO_WORKSPACE}

arch-as-code publish .
```

### 6. View changes on Structurizr

Once you've published your changes, you and others can view your
architecture assets online through your previously created Structurizr
workspace (https://structurizr.com/workspace/${WORKSPACE_ID}).

## Building locally

Use `./gradlew` (Gradle) or `./batect build` (Batect) to build or run tests.

[Batect](https://batect.dev/) works "out of the box", however, an important
optimization is to avoid redownloading plugins and dependencies from within
a Docker container.

With Batect, link to your user local Gradle cache directory:

```
$ ln -s ~/.gradle .gradle-cache
```

This shares Gradle plugin and dependency downloads with the Docker container
run by Batect.

## Build maintenance

Use `./gradlew dependencyUpdates` for a list of out-of-date dependencies and
plugins.
